Library layout
--------------

This is a standard open source library layout. And additional package.conf file is here to
add some meta data to the project.

* library_name
  * CMakeLists.txt
  * package.conf
  * include
     * library_name
        * header.h
  * source
     * source.cpp

Repository layout
-----------------

Libraries could be located anywhere on the repository, but grouping them in a common `libraries/`
directory is a good practice. Note that libraries are respecting a standard SVN layout, using
`branches`, `tags` and `trunk` directories.
Environments are just directories containing symlinks to specific tags of the libraries. You could
even directly point to the library itself if you want an up to date environment.
Users could create their own environments under their private repositories.

  * libraries
     * library1
        * branches
        * tags
           * branch1
           * branch2
        * trunk
           * CMakeLists.txt
           * package.conf 
           * include
              * library1
                 * header.h
           * source
              * source.cpp
     * library2
        * branches
        * tags
           * branch1
           * branch2
        * trunk
           * CMakeLists.txt
           * package.conf 
           * include
              * library2
                 * header.h
           * source
              * source.cpp
  * environments
     * stable
        * library1 -> //repo/libraries/library1/tags/branch1
        * library2 -> //repo/libraries/library2/tags/branch2
     * dev
        * library1 -> //repo/libraries/library1
        * library2 -> //repo/libraries/library2
  * users
     * username
        * custom_env
           * library1 -> //repo/libraries/library1/tags/branch2
           * library2 -> //repo/libraries/library2/tags/branch2

Local layout
------------

An environment file describes all the necessary variables that TPM needs to know
in order to select the right libraries. Variables are self-explanatory.

  * stable.env

        repos_type: svn
        repos_url : svn://svn.host.com/environments/stable
        root_path : /opt/tpm/env/stable

  * ~/.tpmrc

        repo_type: perforce
        repo_url : //depot/users/username/custom_env
        root_path: /home/username/.tpm/custom


Source directory layout
-----------------------

The `TPM_SOURCE_PATH` directory only contains a pristine checkout of the remote package.

  * `TPM_SOURCE_PATH`
     * library1
        * _contents of library1 checkout..._

Build directory layout
-----------------------

The `TPM_BUILD_PATH` directory is where is package is going to be built. TPM will generate
some logs in it, that the user could refer to if anything goes wrong during the install
process. The `install_manifest.txt` file is automatically generated by CMake during the 
`install` target, and contains all the components that were installed on the filesystem.
After a build, the `clean` target is called.

  * `TPM_BUILD_PATH`
     * library1
        * install_manifest.txt
        * checkout.log
        * configuration.log
        * build.log
        * install.log

Install directory layout
------------------------

This is just a pretty standard /usr directory layout. Note than when installing a package,
a file `FindPackage.cmake` is generated and contains everything needed to find and link the
package if necessary. Using `FindX.cmake` files is standard CMake practice and should be
encouraged.

  * `TPM_INSTALL_PATH`
     * bin
        * package1
        * package2
     * lib
        * package3.so
        * package4.a
     * include
        * package1
           * package1.h
        * package2
           * package2.h


`package.conf` format
-------------------

    name        = "gnome"
    depends     = ["x11", "freetype"]
    description = "The gnome window manager"
